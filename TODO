The lower the number, the higher the priority:

1) Add code documentation.
2) Remove hard coded Rectangles to takeScreen shot, allowing the user to select specific Rectangle Area.
3) Remove hard coded min life/mana from Tibia bot, allowing the user to choose specific values.
4) Add some friendly user interface to TibiaBot so that the user start/stop the bot, choose min life/mana to use potions, etc, etc.
5) Add some RNA to DigitRecognizer in order to get reliable results to parse digits, because the current method will fail if user screen's resolution changes.
